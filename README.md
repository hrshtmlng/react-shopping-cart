## Before you start 
<br/>
In order to properly work through this module smoothly we're going to use software that will allow us to write React applications with ease. It's called `create-react-app.`

Go to your command line and execute the following:

`npm install -g create-react-app`

Now verify that you have it by executing the following:

`create-react-app --version`
